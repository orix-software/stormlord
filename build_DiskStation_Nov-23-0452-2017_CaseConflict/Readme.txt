Stormlord is a Single Player 3 level platform game.
The aim of the game is to free all the fairies on each level before the time runs out.

The time is shown as a sun and moon in the score panel. As soon as a full day expires the time will run out and it will be game over.
The number of Fairies to free is shown in the bottom right of the Score panel.
The number of fairies you have collected is displayed to the left of this.
The Score is in the centre and the number of lives to the far left.


BONUS SCREEN
Between each level is a bonus screen where you can gain more lives.
Holding down fire will blow kisses in the form of hearts at the fairies. If they hit a fairy she will shed a single tear. Collect the tear to gain an extra life.

GAMEPLAY
The game is spread over 3 levels. The first is set in the underworld beneath the lands of Stormlord. You can only traverse left or right to the next screen and to climb you must repeatedly jump onto higher ledges.
Stormlord can also fall any height so long as there is a floor beneath him.

You can restart a level by hitting the ESC key, but you will lose a life and your score will be restored to the value is was when you started the level.

The fairies are dotted around the landscape and expect nothing more than you to approach them to free them. They will dissapear on contact.

This is the same for other objects in the game.

OBJECTS
dotted around the levels are various objects.
Each Object has a specific purpose..

The Key
The key will open any door but then you will lose the key.

The Honey
The Honey will attract Bees.

The Boots
The boots will make you jump higher

The Umbrella
the Umbrella will protect you from acid rain.

Also dotted around are Trampolenes.
Trampolenes transport you to other areas of the game. In most places there will also be a trampolene to take you back.

OTHER CREATURES
Throughout Stormlords stomping ground are other creatures that strive to get in your way.

-- Spider --
Spiders move up and down only. Lobbing a few Orbs at them should destroy them.

-- Ball --
This strange ball rises out of a launcher only to fall back inside and repeat.
It can be destroyed with a few orbs.

-- Dragon --
This vicious beast flies in from the side of the screen and attempts to rip your head off.

-- Acid rain --
These blue drops will dissolve your skin should you decide to take a shower. They cannot be destroyed but the Umbrella will protect you.

-- Grubs --
These ground based insects shuffle along the ground and can kill you if they fall on you.

-- Bees --
Bees like to buzz around Honey. If there is no honey then they'll buzz around pots.
They can't be destroyed but can be moved if you posess a Honeypot and can swap it for something else on the screen.

-- Egg Wasps --
These nasty insects fall as eggs from the sky and on landing crack open to reveal wasps within. The can be taken out with an orb or sword.
