<p id=chapter>Instructions</p>


<p>
Stormlord is a Single Player 3 level platform
game.
</p>
<p>
The aim of the game is to free all the fairies
on each level before the time runs out.
The time is shown as a sun and moon in the
score panel. As soon as a full day expires the
time will run out and it will be game over.
The number of Fairies to free is shown in the
bottom right of the Score panel.
<p>
</p>
The Number of fairies you have collected is
displayed to the left of this.

of hearts at the fairies. If they hit a fairy
she will shed a single tear. Collect the tear
to gain an extra life.

<p id=chapter>GAMEPLAY</p>
<p>
The game is spread over 3 levels. The first
is set in the underworld beneath the lands
of Stormlord. You can only traverse left or
right to the next screen and to climb you
must repeatedly jump onto higher ledges.
Stormlord can also fall any height so long
as there is a floor beneath him.
</p>

<p>
You can restart a level by hitting the ESC
key, but you will lose a life and your score
will be restored to the value is was when you
started the level.
</p>

<p>
The fairies are dotted around the landscape
and expect nothing more than you to approach
them to free them. They will dissapear on
contact.
</p>

<p>
This is the same for other objects in the game.
</p>

<p id=chapter>OBJECTS</p>
<p>
dotted around the levels are various objects. Each Object has a specific purpose..
